# Insight---Stock-Prediction-Challenge-

To run the code, add the 3 input files in the "input" directory and then run the run.sh file. An ouput file comparison.txt will be created in "output" directory.

Input file
- actual.txt
- predicted.txt
- window.txt

Output file
- comparison.txt

This model calculates the error of the actual stock prices with the values predicted by the "Stock Prediction Model". 
The value of error further depends on the window size(number of hours) i.e. if the window=4 comparison.txt will shows average 
error of every 4 hours.
